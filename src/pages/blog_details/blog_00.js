                            <p>Big news from the Pikom Unicorn Awards 2019! 
                            </p>

                            <p>Avows won a GBS Pikom award 2019 in Category of Operational Excellence 
                                in Information Technology (OPEIT). The event was graced by Dato Seri Anwar 
                                and esteemed members of Pikom and fellow IT colleagues.
                            </p>

                            <p>“I think it’s a representation of how much focus our team has in creating 
                                value with customers,” said Ashok K Ramavath. “If we didn’t believe we could 
                                truly make a difference for our customers, we wouldn’t have gotten the award.” 
                                “Also, we’re ecstatic to share this achievement with our customers around the world. 
                                Without them, this wouldn’t be possible.”
                            </p>

                            <p>Looking Ahead Creating remarkable experiences isn’t only something our team is devoted 
                                to; it’s a value that’s internalized throughout our entire team. Sure, we’re basking 
                                in the euphoria of these recognitions but we’re also extremely humbled. We can’t 
                                emphasize it enough when we say we owe it all to YOU – this just pushes us to focus 
                                even harder on helping you succeed.
                            </p>
